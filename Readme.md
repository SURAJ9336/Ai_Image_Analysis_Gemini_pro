Vertex AI with Gemini Pro Vision

Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages Google Vertex AI and Gemini Pro Vision to process user-uploaded images and generate responses based on a text prompt. The application demonstrates the integration of cutting-edge Generative AI capabilities into an interactive web interface.

Key Features
Image Upload: Users can upload an image directly through the web interface.
Question Input: Enter a text-based question or prompt related to the uploaded image.
Generative AI: The application processes the uploaded image and text prompt using Googleâ€™s Generative AI capabilities via the gemini-1.5-flash model.
Dynamic Responses: Generates relevant and context-aware answers or outputs based on the provided input.
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive interface powered by Streamlit.

How It Works
Upload an image through the application.
Enter a question or prompt related to the image.
Click "Submit" to generate a response.
The AI processes the image and prompt, returning a meaningful response displayed on the screen.

Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit for building the interactive UI.
Backend: Google Vertex AI (Gemini Pro Vision).
Programming Language: Python.
Libraries Used:
streamlit: For building the web application.
google-generativeai: To interact with Google Vertex AI.
